# Hi there, my name is Roman Khilchenko!
I am a beginner IOS developer.
Completed a 6-month course at Netology on developing mobile applications for IOS devices. As a thesis, they wrote a small social network. After completing the course in Netology, I decided that there was not enough experience to get my first job and took another course at swoftbook school! I recently graduated and am very glad that I decided to take this course! Learned Json parsing, working with databases and a bit of swiftUi.
To be honest, I like to code, but the SwiftBook school offered only Storyboard.
Sometimes I did homework in two files, both code layout and Storybord, I didnâ€™t always have time to sit at the computer, since this is not my main job, but I prefer code layout more!
I am actively looking for a job in IOS development. Honestly, I'm ready for any internship!
